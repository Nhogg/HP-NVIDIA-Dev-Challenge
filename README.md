# Mood Mate - AI-Powered Journaling Insights

## ðŸ§  What It Does

Mood Mate provides an intuitive and clean user interface for journaling. When users submit journal entries, the text is processed by a BERT-based classification model that extracts emotional tags. These tags, along with the entry, are then sent to Googleâ€™s Gemini API to generate personalized insights and suggestions for the user.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** and install the required Python packages.

2. **Run the model locally** inside a Jupyter notebook:
   - The notebook includes cells that load the model, perform classification, and send the data to Gemini.

3. **Frontend access**:
   - Due to time constraints and integration issues with AI Studio and MLflow, the frontend is not persistently connected to the model backend.
   - However, you can explore the UI and view Gemini-generated insights at:
